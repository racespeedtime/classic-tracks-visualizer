# Track Layout · Race Route Studio

**[English](README.md) · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)**

Track Layout is a fully static **GTA San Andreas race-route map builder**. Give it a track JSON that only contains checkpoints; it snaps each CP to the game's road graph, routes between them with A*, renders a customizable route map, and exports PNG / SVG.

> **Pure vibe coding**: architecture, code, debugging, docs and samples were iterated by AI in conversation. It works, but review and test it before production use.

![Track Layout dark UI](docs/preview.webp)

> Inspired by and built on data from [neufox's Node Viewer](https://github.com/itsneufox/neufox-node-viewer) and [neufox's Rec Editor](https://github.com/itsneufox/neufox-rec-editor): plain HTML/CSS/JS + Leaflet `CRS.Simple` + `samap.png`, with no build step and no application backend (`server.js` is only a local static file server).

## Features

- **Track JSON import**: choose a file or drop it in; tolerant parsing for arrays, `checkpoints` / `cps` / `points`, `[x,y,z]`, `pos` / `position`, and similar shapes.
- **Automatic road routing**: the default **Auto** mode prefers a full A* route over SA vehicle nodes. If some CPs cannot snap, it still keeps as much of the road network as possible, fills gaps with straight lines, and explains this under **Route**. You can also force **Road / Spline / Straight**.
- **Closed loops**: when **Closed loop** is enabled, the last point returns to the start and the first point becomes both start and finish.
- **CP editing**: drag on the map, edit coordinates, move up/down, delete, or add CPs by clicking the map. Show or hide checkpoints in both the map and the export; the sidebar list is collapsible and virtualized for tracks with hundreds of CPs.
- **CP display filters**: show all markers, start + finish only, start only, finish only, or **CP style** (all points, including start / finish, rendered as ordinary checkpoints without S/F colours or badges). Marker density can be automatic (about one marker per 600 m, capped at 72), or manual every 2nd / 5th / 10th / 20th. Display thinning never changes routing or CP indices, and the sidebar editing list always keeps every checkpoint.
- **Large warning sets**: the notes/warnings panel is collapsible too, and both warning lists virtualize their rows so large tracks stay responsive.
- **Visual customization**: 9 theme presets; solid / along-route / linear / elevation / rainbow route gradients; outline, glow, dashes, direction arrows; CP shape, size, colors, numbering and labels; base-map brightness / contrast / saturation / hue / invert / blur / tint / grid; title and legend.
- **Custom theme state**: any visual override switches the active theme to **Custom** while remembering the base preset. Changing it back exactly restores the preset automatically; **Restore preset** resets visuals to that base without losing title text, visibility toggles, or a custom base map.
- **PNG export**: 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, 4K, transparent background, and **full track / current view** framing.
- **SVG export**: route, CPs, title and legend stay vector; the base map is embedded as a raster image, or turn it off for a pure-vector route map.
- **Custom base maps**: upload an image and set its coordinate bounds for other games or hand-made maps.
- **Sample library**: the Samples menu has fuzzy search, keyboard navigation and a virtualized scrolling list, so forks can add hundreds of sample tracks without slowing the UI; the sidebar shows the first few plus an "all samples" shortcut.
- **Autosave**: track, styles and export settings live in this browser's `localStorage` and survive reloads.
- **Stacked toasts**: rapid actions show up to five top-center notices at once; extra notices queue and dismiss oldest-first.
- **Shortcut reference**: press `?` or click the keyboard icon to open a grouped keyboard-shortcut dialog. Single-key shortcuts can be disabled there; modifier shortcuts and Escape keep working.
- **Slider helpers**: double-click a range input to restore its current theme/default value; click the numeric readout to type an exact value with min/max validation.
- **Safe CP editing**: map marker dragging is locked by default to prevent accidental moves; press `L` or use the lock button to unlock, and undo/redo checkpoint edits (drag, coordinate input, add/delete/reorder).
- **Responsive map**: window resizing is debounced (180 ms), then the map re-fits the current track; virtual lists and the scale bar refresh at the same time.
- **Route playback**: play a direction arrow from start to finish with a 0.1×–4× speed slider (click the `×` value to type an exact speed); a floating HUD shows playing/paused/finished status and stop controls. Optional map following keeps the arrow centered (dragging or zooming turns it off). The animation is map-preview only and never appears in exports.
- **Collapsible route notes**: route warnings can be folded away and use the same virtualized list rendering for long runs.
- **Clear local cache**: the sidebar footer has a cache reset action that removes this app's `localStorage` and Cache Storage data, then reloads.
- **Responsive workspace**: below 980px the sidebar becomes a bottom sheet with peek / half / full snap points. Drag the handle, tap it, use the chevron, or use `↑` / `↓` / `Home` / `End` while the handle is focused. On desktop the sidebar can be collapsed from the top bar.
- **Compact action menu**: below 720px the top-bar actions collapse into a hamburger panel containing file, sample, fit, language, theme, help and shortcut controls. It closes on outside click, selection, or `Esc`.
- **Movable help dialogs**: drag the title bar of the JSON-format or keyboard-shortcut dialogs to reposition them. Positions are clamped to the viewport, reset when reopened, and double-clicking the title bar recenters.
- **Small-screen controls**: below 480px the section tabs show icons only. Checkpoint, track-note and route-note headers are full-width collapse toggles, not just the chevron.
- **Toast feedback**: Ant-Design-style elevated notices with success/error/info icons, soft shadows, top-center stacking and slide-fade motion.
- **Title / legend placement**: independently anchor both overlays to any of six positions (top/middle/bottom × left/center/right), then fine-tune horizontal and vertical offsets as percentages of the canvas. The same placement is used by the live map, PNG, SVG, mini preview and fullscreen preview.
- **Live export preview**: the thumbnail in the Export pane re-renders after style, route, or size changes and shows a loading spinner while the next frame is being prepared.
- **Export watermark**: the bottom-right `GTA: SAN ANDREAS · TRACK LAYOUT` credit can be enabled or disabled in the Export pane.
- **Fullscreen preview**: click the preview image to open a full-viewport lightbox with wheel/trackpad zoom, pinch zoom on touch screens, drag-to-pan, double-click reset, and an optional native Fullscreen API button. Keyboard: `+`/`-` zoom, arrows pan, `0` reset, `Esc` close.
- **Source link**: the sidebar footer GitHub icon opens the source repository.
- **Internationalization**: first visit follows the browser locale (`zh*` → Simplified Chinese, everything else → English); the `EN / 中文` picker in the top bar overrides it. UI, map title/legend, CP list, notices, help and PNG/SVG export text all follow the active language.
- **Dark / light UI**: choose **System / Dark / Light** in the top bar. **System** follows `prefers-color-scheme` live, and the choice is remembered in this browser. This only affects the app chrome, not the route-map artwork itself.

## Quick Start

Requires Node.js 18+. The app is static: no build step and no `npm install` required.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dockfries/track-layout
cd track-layout

# Option A (recommended): temporary static server via npx
npx --yes serve . -l 8173

# Option B: the zero-dependency static server in this repo
node server.js 8173
# or: npm start
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8173/>. The first visit automatically loads the Dirt sample.

- `npx serve` downloads `serve` temporarily on first use; it does not write into this repo.
- `npm run serve` is equivalent to Option A; `npm start` is equivalent to Option B.
- Both options only serve static files. No track data is uploaded.
- If port 8173 is taken, `serve` may choose another port; use the URL printed in the terminal.
- Open the app over HTTP. It needs `fetch('data/nodes.json')`; double-clicking `index.html` will be blocked by the browser's `file://` restrictions.

Tests:

```bash
npm test
# or: node tests/run.js
```

## Language / Internationalization

- **Default language**: the first visit reads `navigator.languages`. Chinese locales such as `zh`, `zh-CN` and `zh-Hans` get Simplified Chinese; every other locale gets English.
- **Switch and remember**: use the `EN / 中文` picker in the top bar. The choice is stored in `localStorage` under `track-layout:lang`.
- **Coverage**: static UI, tabs, help dialog, map title/legend, CP list, route notices, toasts, sample names, theme names, and PNG/SVG title, legend and CP labels all follow the active language.
- **Adding strings**: UI copy uses semantic English keys in the `MESSAGES` table in `js/i18n.js` (`key: { en, zh }`); legacy Chinese text in static HTML is mapped through `STATIC_TEXT`, and rich help HTML lives in `RICH`. Add entries when you add UI copy.
- `html.i18n-pending` hides the UI until a language is applied, so English users do not see a flash of Chinese text.

## Appearance

![Light UI](docs/preview-light.webp)

- Use the **System / Dark / Light** picker in the top bar to switch the workbench appearance.
- **System** follows `prefers-color-scheme` and updates live when the OS changes.
- Manual choices are stored in `localStorage` under `track-layout:theme` and survive reloads; choose **System** to follow the OS again.
- Appearance only affects the workbench UI (sidebar, dialogs, map controls, etc.). The map title, legend, CP markers and export artwork are still controlled by the themes under **Style**.

## Track JSON Format

The simplest form is an **ordered CP array**; array order is track order:

```json
{
  "name": "Dirt",
  "author": "your name",
  "closed": false,
  "checkpoints": [
    { "x": 1067.495, "y": 2292.726, "z": 10.432 },
    { "x": 727.516, "y": 2296.72, "z": 24.04 },
    { "x": 548.414, "y": 2323.843, "z": 32.481 }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `checkpoints` | yes* | Checkpoint array. Also accepts `cps` / `points` / `cp` / `waypoints`. |
| `name` | no | Track name; falls back to the file name. |
| `author` | no | Author. |
| `description` | no | Description; kept only in the JSON. |
| `closed` | no | Whether the track is a closed loop; default `false`. |
| `map` | no | Map name; default `san-andreas`. |
| `checkpoints[].x` / `.y` | yes | World coordinates. `x` is east, `y` is north. |
| `checkpoints[].z` | no | Elevation; used for elevation gradients and height-aware snapping. |
| `checkpoints[].label` | no | Display label. |
| `checkpoints[].radius` | no | Reserved field, preserved as-is. |

\* A top-level array is also accepted: `[{ "x": 0, "y": 0 }, ...]`.

Accepted variants:

```json
[
  [100, 200, 10],
  { "pos": [300, 400, 12] },
  { "position": { "x": 500, "y": 600, "z": 8 } },
  { "x": 700, "y": 800, "type": "finish", "label": "Finish" }
]
```

**Roles come from order, not `type`**: for an open track the first point is Start and the last is Finish; for a closed loop the first point is Start / Finish. `type` is parsed, but the final role is always determined by order.

**CP numbering**: Start / Finish use `S`, `F` and `S/F` badges; ordinary checkpoints use their array index. The sidebar, map markers and route notices all share this numbering.

See [`track.schema.json`](track.schema.json) for the full JSON Schema and [`samples/`](samples/) for examples.

## Routing

- The road graph comes from `data/nodes.json` (extracted from `NODES0.DAT`–`NODES63.DAT`: 30,587 vehicle nodes and about 63k directed connections).
- Each CP looks for a vehicle node within the **snap radius** (80 m by default); when `z` is available, height difference adds a penalty. Snapping prefers the main road component when every CP can join it, otherwise it stays on the nearest local component so short island routes are not detoured.
- Adjacent CPs are connected with **A\***. Edge cost = 2D length × average of the two node weights:

  | Node type | Weight |
  | --- | --- |
  | Highway | 0.8 |
  | Normal road | 1.0 |
  | Parking | 1.3 |
  | Emergency lane | 2.6 |
  | Water path | 12 |

- **Auto** first tries a full road-network A* route. If some CPs cannot snap or some segments are unreachable, it keeps the reachable road parts, fills gaps with straight lines, and shows **partial road** plus the specific reasons under **Route**. If no leg at all can be routed, it uses straight connections. Only when the road graph is unavailable does it fall back to a **Catmull–Rom spline**.
- **Road** mode routes segment by segment, fills failed segments with straight lines, and lists the reasons under **Route**.
- Road routes are simplified with Douglas–Peucker and 0–2 Chaikin corner-cutting passes for a cleaner race line; the smoothing slider controls the strength.
- Closed loops additionally route the last point back to the start.

Limitation: a custom base map only changes the display, not the coordinate system or the road graph. Routing still uses GTA SA vehicle nodes. Use **Spline** or **Straight** for air, water or hand-made maps.

## Visual Styling

- **Theme presets**: Neon Night, Tactical Radar, Paper Map, Miami Sunset, Blueprint, Mono, Cyberpunk 2077, White Chocolate, Rainbow Flow.
- **Route gradients**:
  - Solid
  - Along route: start color → finish color over route length
  - Linear: gradient in canvas direction
  - Elevation: gradient by CP / route `z`
  - Rainbow: continuous full-spectrum light trail, Tesla style
- **Route layer**: outline, glow, dashes, direction arrows (spacing / size / color). Automatic arrow spacing targets ~48 arrows with a 140 m minimum, so full-map routes stay readable.
- **Checkpoints**: show / hide, display range, marker density, CP-style endpoints, uniform start/finish colours, circle / square / diamond, size, fill, border, numbering, labels, halo, start color, finish color.
- **Base map**: brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, invert, blur, tint strength, grid (8 × 8 on the standard SA bounds), optional grid numbers (0 at the top-left, row-major), background color, visibility; upload a custom image and set `minX/maxX/minY/maxY`. Custom images are not written to `localStorage` (too large); re-select them after reload, while bounds are saved.
- **Title & legend**: show switches, eyebrow, title, subtitle, text/accent/background colors, background opacity, overall scale, title font size, subtitle font size, legend background.

Can visual styles be saved to JSON? Currently they are autosaved in `localStorage` only; **Save JSON** contains track data, not visual styles.

## Export

**Preview export** renders a fresh PNG at the current output size in a dialog; **Download PNG** and **Download SVG** use the same renderer.

- **PNG**: raster output, transparent background, full track / current map view, 16:9 / 4:3 / 1:1 / 9:16 / 4K or custom sizes (up to 4096).
- **SVG**: route, CPs, arrows, title and legend stay vector; the base map is embedded as a cropped raster with current filters/tint. Turn off **Include base map** for a pure-vector route map.
- Exports crop to the track bounds with padding; near map edges the viewport is pushed back inside the map where possible to avoid blank strips.
- Title scale, title/subtitle font sizes, theme colors and map filters are re-rendered for export, not screenshotted.
- Very long titles and subtitles are ellipsized to fit the export instead of running past the canvas edge.

### Git Ignore Rules

`.gitignore` only excludes local artifacts such as `node_modules/`, logs, build caches, `.env`, editor/OS files, temporary backups, and headless-browser artifacts such as `tools/debug/`, `tools/edge-*/` and `tools/*-profile/`.

`data/nodes.json`, `assets/samap.png`, `assets/icons/`, `docs/preview.webp`, `docs/preview-light.webp`, `samples/*.json` and `vendor/leaflet/` are required runtime or documentation assets. **Keep them in the repository**; do not delete them or add them to the ignore list.

## Rebuilding the Sample Index

The bundled library contains the classic-pool tracks. Every sample is a regular track JSON file under [`samples/`](samples/); `samples/index.json` stores the display name, CP count and road-routed length shown in the Samples menu. After adding, removing or editing sample files, rebuild the index:

```bash
npm run samples
```

The script routes every sample with the app's default settings, writes `index.json`, and leaves the track files untouched.

## Credits

**Pure vibe coding**: architecture, code, debugging, docs and samples were iterated by AI in conversation; there is no hand-written line-by-line implementation. Review and test before use.

### Reference Projects

- **[neufox's Node Viewer](https://github.com/itsneufox/neufox-node-viewer)**: provided `samap.png`, `data/nodes.json` (extracted from `NODES0.DAT`–`NODES63.DAT`), the Leaflet `CRS.Simple` map presentation, and the vehicle-node flags / adjacency structure. This project extends those data and ideas with CP snapping, A* routing and route rendering.
- **[neufox's Rec Editor](https://github.com/itsneufox/neufox-rec-editor)**: provided the static, no-build page organization and interaction ideas around path smoothing / resampling / drag editing. The CP editor, map interaction and export flow here reference it.

### Data and Third-Party Assets
